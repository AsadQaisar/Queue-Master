# Queue Master

**Queue Master** is an interactive **Python application** designed for modeling and simulating **multi-server queuing systems** commonly found in real-world environments like customer service centers. Built using **customtkinter** for the GUI, along with **NumPy**, **SciPy**, and **CSV** libraries for mathematical computations and data handling, this tool helps users visualize and analyze queuing models.

The application features an intuitive graphical interface that allows users to set up simulation parameters, define queue characteristics, and run the model to simulate different queuing scenarios. Additionally, it provides the option to **export simulation data to CSV** for further analysis, making it an essential tool for optimizing queuing systems in various domains such as telecommunications, healthcare, and retail.
